/**
 * OMP sends the extension `agent_end` notification detached, after its

 * next run or scheduled continuation can therefore start, run its context
 * pass, and even dispatch before the previous run's end reaches this hook.
 * The event names no operation, so an end that arrives while the latest pass
 * has not been dispatched yet is attributed from evidence:
 * - `willContinue` says the agent continues, so a not-yet-dispatched pass is
 *   the continuation's own pass (or will be replaced by it);
 * - a pass whose input, as captured before its handler ran, holds a message
 *   the ended run never had (OMP clones messages, so role + timestamp
 *   identify them) was built for a later run.
 * A pass that was already dispatched keeps the original behaviour: the end
 * invalidates its receipt for any later request.
