# Pi large-session append cost: session-local tags and incremental identity

## Scope and evidence

Compared production context handlers at base `0f8f341c8c4b27df6bf9678e022250ef3a9b8ac4` and the implementation delivered with this report. Linux, 8 vCPUs, Bun 1.4.2. Synthetic Pi projection with a persisted system entry withheld from the hook, tool calls/results, reasoning, images, reused call IDs, and a lingering unadoptable fallback. The final projection contains **13,930 messages, 99,931 tags, and 5,105,660 served JSON bytes**.

A second **initialized** connection commits unrelated metadata before every pass. Six checkpoints warm the handler; 86,000 compacted, out-of-projection tags are then inserted. The first append absorbs those rows and is excluded from latency statistics. There are **64 subsequent two-message append samples**. Across all **71 passes**, 284 comparisons verify identical literal served JSON SHA-256, canonical output SHA-256, behavioral tag-row SHA-256, and served byte count. The oracle is the independent base handler, not an expected value derived by the new cache.

This is not a replay of private ANTAUTH data or a live provider test. In particular, its fallback median does not reproduce the live 116 ms / 2.5 s conflict workload. No live store or live configuration was opened. All database execution, suites and benchmarks ran on Linux against test-owned roots; no macOS Pi/OpenCode host was launched, so the host-PID `lsof` requirement was not exercised. The benchmark explicitly assigns all XDG roots, `OPENCODE_DB`, `MAGIC_CONTEXT_STORAGE_DIR`, and the test data root below its throwaway directory. It removes that directory on exit.

## Before and after

Milliseconds; independent stage percentiles, not additive accounting:

| Stage | Before median / p90 | After median / p90 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Entire hook (`total`) | 517.542 / 637.110 | **302.677 / 344.652** |
| Tag snapshot including active projection | 114.929 / 136.428 | **2.832 / 3.404** |
| Fallback identity/adoption | 9.524 / 15.960 | 11.366 / 12.933 |
| Channel accounting | 112.458 / 140.466 | **59.515 / 66.472** |
| Post-transform phase (includes channel accounting) | 118.784 / 151.518 | **65.215 / 73.016** |
| LKG capture | 47.422 / 513.035 | 37.693 / 363.140 |
| Model-change timing label | 0.134 / 0.191 | 0.008 / 0.011 |
| Newly separated pressure resolution | not separately timed | 0.096 / 0.138 |

Whole-hook median improves **41.5%**, p90 **45.9%**. Fallback median is slightly worse in this fixture: exact primitive validation is not free, and the base already hashes very little when the lingering fingerprint matches no message. Do not interpret the new model-change timing as an equivalent speedup: the old timer included pressure handling and scheduler work.

## What changed

* **Tags:** the old reader discarded its full session snapshot on every foreign `data_version` change, including unrelated sessions and metadata. It now uses a full-row session revision beside the existing identity-only revision, in the same KV table and shared connection-only trigger installer. Identity/owner-summary semantics remain unchanged. The local changed-number journal supplies this connection's replacements; subtracting the local session counter from the shared session counter detects foreign writes to that session only. Inserts, deletes, renumbers, session moves, status/size edits and rollbacks are covered. Every reopened connection starts with a full load. The public snapshot API still returns editable copies; the handler's internal projection retains frozen row objects and publishes a new array on changes.
* **Fallback identity:** exact detached primitive-field comparison identifies the first changed input. Only the suffix gets fingerprints, tool-owner memberships and real-ID positions rebuilt. Historical fingerprint selection uses header buckets; writer-admitted expansion reuses those buckets rather than hashing or resolving all history again. Known tagged prefix messages no longer enter the tool-allocation guard. The issue-650 pairing, served-number survivor, refusal, once-repair and tagger-binding decisions are unchanged. Rewrites, reordered IDs, context edits, deletions and fallback-to-real settlement invalidate at the first exact mismatch. LKG's existing detached input fields are reused where temporal markers are disabled and thinking strips occur at the end; otherwise only identity-relevant primitive fields are flattened. Session teardown and a different database handle discard the index.
* **Hygiene:** cached tag attribution maps fold changed immutable rows instead of rebuilding every historical tag map. Canonically ordered old/new rows are compared by primitive number and row identity. Changed owners alone have their bounds recomputed. Duplicate-number/key legacy stores retain the full last-row-wins path. The already-required rendered-part walk also supplies the real-user count, removing its second walk.
* **LKG:** reuse the result of exact input-prefix validation for the same accepted in-memory slot, while retaining the digest-format fence. Foreign/reopened slots use the ordinary id/signature validation. Output validation and transactional persisted-chunk checks remain intact.
* **Model spikes:** `modelChangeDetection` previously spanned pressure reconciliation, recovery writes, rejected-usage full request tokenization and scheduling. Model seeding walks the branch only on restart. Legacy proven-floor re-derivation is also one-time. Pressure now has its own timing label. This fixture does not reproduce the live 990 ms spike, so it cannot distinguish SQLite writer contention from rejected-usage recovery in that historical sample.

## Remaining linear floor

The task owner explicitly approved retaining exact safety validation rather than introducing a host change protocol or redesigning LKG persistence. Fresh Pi clones and extension rewrites cannot safely be assumed append-only from IDs, lengths or timestamps alone: same-length text and nested tool arguments must be compared too. The following stage measurements bound the remaining visible-history work (inclusive stages overlap):

| Remaining work | After median / p90 (ms) |
|---|---:|
| Branch/event alignment, input field capture, stable-ID reusable set | 31.698 / 36.858 |
| Fallback primitive-prefix validation and indexed discovery | 11.366 / 12.933 |
| Transcript construction | 1.510 / 1.698 |
| Tag identity/source validation | 31.574 / 34.786 |
| Rebuilding § prefixes on fresh raw clones | 5.242 / 6.459 |
| Fresh mutation targets/proxies | 3.948 / 4.725 |
| Token-cache primitive validation | 19.478 / 22.844 |
| Token accounting, including the preceding validation | 20.720 / 24.723 |
| Stable-ID maps after commit | 2.103 / 2.576 |
| Compartment replay/injection | 2.197 / 3.188 |
| Dropped-placeholder scan | 0.378 / 0.462 |
| Processed-image replay scan | 0.692 / 0.908 |
| Reasoning replay/clear scans (each) | 0.232 / 0.266; 0.234 / 0.270 |
| Successful-transform/reusable-ID bookkeeping | 2.422 / 2.781 |
| Note index maps | 1.323 / 1.652 |
| Note/nudge postprocess | 3.434 / 4.281 |
| Final thinking-binding scans | 1.221 / 1.707 |
| Final rendered hygiene validation, attribution-delta comparison and protection checks | 59.515 / 66.472 |
| Assistant usage/work-metrics fold | 0.649 / 0.902 |
| LKG exact final-output capture, digest arrays, chunk hashing and persistence | 37.693 / 363.140 |
| Snapshot row-array copy/merge and active-tag projection (session tags, not only visible messages) | 2.832 / 3.404 |

No claim is made that the whole hook is now O(new messages). Identity rebuilding and tag SQL reads are incremental, but primitive validation, rendered output/proxy reconstruction and durable recovery bytes still scale with visible history; tag-array comparisons/protection still scale with the session's tags. A host-provided append/change protocol is the next structural prerequisite. LKG p90 remains high; persisted recovery-chunk hashing/writes are deliberately not replaced by an in-memory stamp.

## Foreign-writer coverage and known limit

These are TEMP triggers, not durable schema triggers. Current plugin and Pi runtime opens use shared `openDatabase`/`openDatabaseAsync` and install them. CLI `doctor store init` for a missing store, single-store migration, and fresh/salvaged database preparation use initialized opens as well. Ordinary existing-store doctor read/mutation helpers (`packages/cli/src/lib/database-access.ts`) **do not** initialize the connection. The Rust dashboard's read-write `rusqlite` opener (`packages/dashboard/src-tauri/src/db.rs`) **does not** install them either. Uninitialized raw SQLite clients and mixed-version older Magic Context processes lacking the full-row counter are outside this contract. Their same-session edits may remain cached until a recognized session change or reopening. No fallback session scan was added for those writers, per the task owner's decision.

The pre-existing sibling-probe test was changed to initialize its writer and name that prerequisite; its assertions that foreign tags are observed remain unchanged. This deliberately narrows the prior arbitrary-raw-writer contract, rather than silently promising cross-version invalidation.

## Reproduction

Archive base packages/scripts into a scratch directory **inside an isolated worktree**, link its package `node_modules` to the worktree's installed dependencies, and copy the current perf `run.ts` into the archive. This only gives both handlers the same isolation, delayed-seeding and literal-wire-hash instrumentation; runtime source remains independently versioned. Run on Linux with 8 vCPUs:

```sh
POINTS="$(python3 -c 'print(",".join(map(str,[2500,5000,7500,10000,12500,13800]+list(range(13802,13930,2)))))')"
# Run once with each handler's run.ts, producing before.json and after.json:
bun packages/pi-plugin/scripts/experiments/perf/run.ts \
  --messages 13930 --points "$POINTS" --pi087 --external-writes \
  --lingering-fallback --historical-tags 86000 \
  --historical-tags-after-messages 13800 --tool-result-repeat 30 \
  --output <before-or-after.json>
bun packages/pi-plugin/scripts/experiments/perf/summarize-append.ts before.json after.json
```

Seeding 86,000 hidden tags before bulk cold warm-up exceeded the base's 25-second outcome budget during allocation. Delayed seeding avoids benchmarking that unrelated cold-allocation limitation; it does not change the production deadline. The base and optimized append outputs were then compared without weakening the deadline.

## Verification

* Root `bun run typecheck`: passed, TypeScript 5.9.3; four package scripts, including plugin script typecheck.
* Root `bun run lint`: passed, Biome 2.5.1; 1,376 plugin, 304 Pi, 138 CLI and 6 retina files. Existing warnings/infos remain.
* Pi package suite: **1,970 passed, 28 skipped, zero failed**, 1,998 tests across 204 files, Bun 1.4.2. Frozen view consumers, issue-650 behavior and real-change regressions are covered.
* Root `bun run build`: passed on Linux, including plugin, Pi and CLI bundles; TUI checked nine files with no changes.
* Plugin suite after building required worker artifacts: **7,691 passed, 27 skipped, two failed**, 7,720 tests across 779 files. One is the pre-existing offline Node WASM fixture (`onnxruntime-web/webgpu` unavailable from the throwaway wrapper); this same test was reproduced against the archived base. The writer-diagnostics timing test was flaky in the parallel suite; its five-test file passed twice in isolation. No unrelated code was changed to mask either failure.
* Shared owner-summary/writer diagnostics narrow gate: **18 passed**, 168 assertions, including status-only stability, foreign identity edits and the uninitialized-writer residual contract.
* Scoped AFT diagnostics: six implementation files covered, zero diagnostics. Non-diagnostic call-graph categories were unavailable; authoritative root typecheck is the gate.

## Mutation controls

Each control used the staged live implementation as its restore point, recorded a non-empty `git diff --stat` during the mutation, ran the named tests, then used `git checkout -- <path> && touch <path>` and recorded an empty unstaged diff. Mutants carried the literal `NON-VACUITY BREAK` marker and were never committed.

* Ignoring foreign session revisions reddened only `100k-tag snapshots ignore foreign metadata and other sessions, but reload foreign same-session edits and reopened connections`; `tag snapshots refresh only changed numbers on append and preserve canonical bytes` remained green.
* Reusing fallback fingerprints by ID without comparing primitive fields reddened only `fallback index discards stale fingerprints, positions and owner aliases on same-length extension rewrites`; the 13,800-entry append bound and context_edit/reorder/deletion/settlement parity controls remained green.
* Ignoring replaced immutable tag rows reddened only `immutable hygiene tag attribution extends appends and rebuilds rewritten, deleted and reowned rows`; the combined real-user counting control remained green.
* Blessing every LKG input as an exact reusable prefix reddened only `LKG own-slot digest reuse stops at a same-id same-length input rewrite`; the append-only digest-reuse control remained green.
* Rebuilding the fallback index from zero on every pass reddened only `fallback index rebuilds only appended messages at 13,800 entries`; context_edit/reorder/deletion/settlement parity remained green. This proves the append work-bound check is not vacuous.
* After restoring all five mutations, the focused five-file gate passed **50 tests, 459 assertions**, with Pi typecheck and lint green again (TypeScript 5.9.3, Biome 2.5.1). The repository's frozen-lockfile test install checked 1,013 installs across 1,254 packages without changes.

## Independent-review repairs and lifecycle completion

The independent review at `533ec3a007` (reviewing `873ee682`) was cherry-picked. Its report remains historical evidence; its reproduction file moved into the normal Pi suite as `packages/pi-plugin/src/append-cache-review-regressions.test.ts`.

### Correctness changes

* Full-row revisions now survive reusable `clearSession` calls. Deleting tags advances the counter; clearing/recreating the same UUID never restarts it. Snapshot comparisons use exact inequality, including a lower externally restored stamp, not a greater-than check.
* A connection-only **before-insert conflict observer** probes the three actual tag uniqueness constraints: primary ID, session/tag number, and owned-tool composite key. It stamps displaced sessions before `REPLACE` can silently delete rows with recursive triggers disabled. The same selected rows feed the local old-number journal. This explicitly fixes the **local REPLACE journal defect inherited from master**, not just the new foreign invalidation hole. Neither SQLite's global recursive-trigger mode nor the durable schema was changed. Conflict/upsert/ignored-insert stamps are conservative and transactional.
* The observer also advances displaced sessions' existing `tags_version`. Consumer review found the warm assignment map, fallback-call-ID set and inert-whitespace projection depended on that signal. Tests now cover warm taggers at unchanged floors, actual reassignment to persisted rows, cache refresh and unchanged wire rejection of missing whitespace rows.
* Consumer review additionally reproduced clear/recreate aliases in those version-based caches and in the owner summary after an explicit-primary-ID reimport. **Identity revision keys are now retained and advanced on reusable clears**, rather than deleted. Tagger and fallback signatures pair that epoch with `tags_version`; whitespace caching includes the loaded identity epoch. Ordinary status/drop-mode UPDATE selectivity for the owner summary is unchanged, and plain fresh allocations do not alter the identity epoch, preserving the existing own-write fast path.
* Hygiene reconstructs canonical last-row-wins attribution on its first transition into duplicate keys, including a lower-number newcomer competing with an unchanged higher row. The fallback index remembers prior duplicate IDs and rebuilds when leaving that state, retaining surviving owners/positions.
* **Permanent deletion differs from reusable reset.** The host `session.deleted` handler and durable cleanup retries explicitly retire counters; the authoritative OpenCode orphan sweep does likewise. Reusable clears retain a producing-harness marker in the existing KV table, so epoch-only sessions remain discoverable without treating Pi/OMP sessions as OpenCode orphans. Retirement retains both counters while another harness has live context rows or its own marker. Pi switch/shutdown remains in-memory cleanup, not permanent deletion. Pi/OMP and OpenCode 2 sweeps remain parked according to the existing host-authority rules.

The identity-revision deletion test was updated deliberately: a reusable/partial clear must advance its value, while confirmed final deletion still removes it. The clear-session transaction test now verifies every owned table is deleted and every executed write occurs inside the one transaction, rather than relying on a fragile prepared-statement count. These are explained contract changes, not silent reversals of the old claims.

### Expanded differential and served-byte oracle

The permanent randomized test compares literal snapshot JSON to an authoritative full reload after **15,000 operations** over three deterministic seeds, four initialized connections and three sessions, including transactional reads and commit/rollback. The expanded operation mix executed **1,653 clear operations, 812 recreations and 846 REPLACE operations** (including operations later rolled back). Dedicated cases cover all replacement constraints simultaneously, recursive-trigger OFF/ON settings, multiple displaced sessions, exact-ID import, repeat/lower stamps and surviving harnesses.

The final independent-handler oracle compares archived master `0f8f341c` against the repaired implementation with **13,930 messages, 99,931 tags and 4,604,108 served bytes**. It passed **77 literal-JSON + 77 wire-hash + 77 behavioral-tag comparisons**, including same-ID extension rewrite, revert, context_edit removal, revert after the edit and compaction contraction. Sixty-five warmed append samples exclude initial warm-up, hidden-tag catch-up and the final five real-change controls.

| Final oracle stage | Archived base median / p90 (ms) | Repaired median / p90 (ms) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Total | 463.638 / 527.017 | **299.873 / 324.159** |
| Tag snapshot | 103.177 / 113.624 | **2.703 / 3.004** |
| Fallback identity/adoption | 8.640 / 11.115 | 11.337 / 12.437 |
| Channel accounting | 98.117 / 126.139 | **57.954 / 61.900** |
| Post-transform | 104.804 / 133.944 | **64.161 / 67.836** |
| LKG capture | 36.336 / 48.076 | 34.324 / 44.510 |

This latest fixture has a different payload size/schedule from the initial timing table above; do not mix their percentiles. The final whole-hook median improves 35.3%, p90 38.5% against its own independent base. Exact validation and output construction remain linear as documented earlier; this is not a claim of an append-only host protocol.

### Isolation, limits and final gates

All runtime execution remained on Linux with 8 requested vCPUs. The isolation probe's PID **9** listed only `context.db`, WAL and SHM beneath `/motor-home/tmp/magic-context/pi-append-review-fixes/run.ARL3ii/review-lsof-JrXRbH/`; all six requested environment roots were under the surrounding throwaway root. Roots, raw wire files and generated runners were removed. No live store/configuration or macOS host was accessed. `lsof` warned about inaccessible tracefs, and Bun printed an internal directory-mismatch warning after the oracle completed; the oracle exited zero after all explicit comparisons.

The uninitialized/older-writer compatibility limit remains **by explicit task-owner decision**. The former raw-writer red probe is now named `known limit: uninitialized foreign writes stay stale until a recognized session change or reopen`; it verifies staleness, recognized-change refresh and an unconditional full load on reopening. Writable CLI doctor/dashboard handles are not themselves proof of current tag writes: the independent inventory found their ordinary paths do not currently mutate legacy tags. Concrete unsupported tag writers are raw clients and older same-schema Pi/OpenCode versions.

Final authoritative gates: Bun **1.4.2**, TypeScript **5.9.3**, Biome **2.5.1**.

* Root typecheck and report-asset typecheck passed. Root lint passed on 1,376 plugin / 305 Pi / 138 CLI / 6 retina files; existing warnings/infos remain.
* Root build passed: seven bundler invocations; TUI checked nine files with no changes.
* Pi suite: **1,994 passed, 28 skipped, zero failed**; 2,022 tests across 205 files.
* Plugin suite: **7,694 passed, 27 skipped, one failed**; 7,722 tests across 779 files. The sole failure remains the independently reproduced baseline offline Node-WASM fixture (`onnxruntime-web/webgpu` cannot be resolved from its throwaway wrapper). The earlier embedding timing flake and unrelated writer timing flake did not recur in the final run.
* Frozen-lockfile install again checked 1,013 installs / 1,254 packages with no changes.

### Review-repair mutation evidence

Every mutant used a staged live restore point, a non-empty `git diff --stat` during mutation, `git checkout -- <path> && touch <path>` restoration, and an empty unstaged diff afterward. Each selected final control reddened only the named regression and retained its positive companion:

* Full-row tombstone reset → foreign clear/recreate regression.
* Missing old-session full revision → foreign REPLACE move; same-session foreign renumber remained green.
* Missing old-number journal keys, with local counts still mirrored → inherited local REPLACE renumber; foreign renumber remained green.
* Missing canonical duplicate transition rebuild → hygiene lower-number duplicate regression.
* Ignoring prior duplicated IDs → fallback survivor membership regression.
* Greater-than-only revision comparison → lower-restored-stamp regression.
* Missing both old-session consumer signals → warm tagger assignment, cached fallback IDs and cached whitespace refresh, in separate sole-red runs.
* Missing replacement identity stamp → count/primary-ID-preserving owner rekey regression.
* Missing retained-identity comparison → warm tagger clear/recreate regression and fallback clear/recreate regression, in separate runs.
* Missing loaded-identity whitespace comparison → recreated §7 whitespace replay regression.
* Resetting the identity tombstone → explicit-ID owner reimport regression.
* Missing terminal retirement → permanent deletion cleanup regression.
* Missing marker discovery → epoch-only orphan discovery regression.
* Missing surviving-harness marker fence → cross-harness epoch retention regression.

Two initial probes were non-vacuous only after refinement: a wire-only whitespace assertion stayed green because existing row-existence validation suppressed missing digits; the final test also observes cache refresh. A same-process owner probe stayed green because JS write-generation tracking masked the missing foreign stamp; the final probe uses an initialized native SQLite connection that bypasses those JS hooks, and it reddens when the stamp is removed. Both initial undefended runs and the subsequent same-target red controls are disclosed in the delivery evidence.

## Round-two terminal ID-reuse closure (post-0.48.0 merge)

Review `b2744cf62d` was cherry-picked. Its remaining conditional Medium reproduced an already-open foreign snapshot/tagger caching obsolete rows after a permanent deletion removed counters and the same session ID was recreated. The named test moved unchanged in intent into the permanent Pi file `tag-revision-incarnation.test.ts`.

The database now keeps one persistent KV allocation counter, `tag_revision_incarnation`. **Only first creation of a revision row advances it**, atomically inside the writing statement. Revision values encode `serial:localCount`; a reused session therefore cannot alias an older lifetime even if it reaches the exact same local count. The task owner approved this opaque format: a numeric seed alone would still overlap after enough local increments. Full-row creation also establishes an identity revision at count zero, so a tagger that never observed an identity UPDATE still distinguishes lifetimes. Permanent deletion continues removing all per-session counters and provenance; no session tombstones were restored.

Existing scalar values parse as reserved lifetime serial zero. Pi compares exact text stamps after subtracting its local write count **inside SQLite**, preserving integer precision; counts and serials are never ordered across lifetimes. Updating an existing legacy counter normalizes its representation without invalidating a snapshot for that connection's own writes. Existing scalar identity values retain the tagger's ordinary append fast path. Counter/serial exhaustion aborts the statement atomically instead of wrapping into an old value.

A newly created identity key initially exposed a tagger hot-path regression. The final implementation mirrors its own first epoch under the existing immediate allocation transaction only when the loaded snapshot still matches writer admission. It does not adopt a peer's stamp after commit. The four existing signature-cache regressions are green again, and the new owned/peer-first case proves that admission distinction.

Nine permanent tests cover the review's foreign-reader failure, repeated terminal reuse at local count 42, no per-session accumulation, all first-creation paths, transaction rollback, legacy scalar upgrade without whole-history reload, exact serials above JavaScript's safe-integer limit, exhaustion and initial-epoch ownership. The existing 15,000-operation differential and 100k-tag snapshot checks remain green.

### Warm cost and controls

`incarnation-cost.ts` compared the creation trigger installed versus dropped **after both counter rows were initialized**, leaving existing-counter update SQL and tag observers identical. Linux/Bun 1.4.2: 72 databases, nine samples per cell, **396,000 measured inserts**, and 72 checks that the global counter stayed unchanged. Median microseconds per row (trigger removed / installed): message autocommit 50.133 / 51.538, message bulk 13.918 / 14.988, tool autocommit 58.487 / 58.556, tool bulk 17.308 / 18.220. p90 had substantial unrelated machine/I/O outliers (including 3,153.983 us in the trigger-removed tool cell); no strict wall-clock equality is claimed. The invariant is stronger and deterministic: **zero global allocation-clock writes on warmed inserts or updates**; allocation SQL runs only on revision-row creation.

Four safe, staged fix-removal controls each reddened only its named test, with rollback/warm-clock companions green: constant lifetime serial → the exact r2 foreign-reader test; updating the clock on every insert → warm-clock invariant; omitting initial owned-epoch mirroring → owned/peer-first cache test; skipping writer-admission validation → that same test's peer-stamp rejection. All mutants carried NON-VACUITY BREAK, had non-empty applied diffs, and were restored to empty unstaged diffs before delivery.

### Final verification

Linux, 8 requested vCPUs; Bun **1.4.2**, TypeScript **5.9.3**, Biome **2.5.1**. Root typecheck, r2 asset typecheck, root lint and build passed. Lint covered 1,376 plugin / 306 Pi / 138 CLI / 6 retina files; build ran seven bundles and checked nine TUI files unchanged. Pi full suite: **2,002 passed, 28 skipped, one existing timing flake**, 2,031 tests across 206 files. The sole failure was the same embedding-deadline case already recorded in the independent r2 baseline (3,308.66 ms in the parallel run); its complete three-test file passed in isolation. Plugin final suite: **7,694 passed, 27 skipped, one pre-existing offline Node-WASM fixture failure**, 7,722 tests across 779 files. The tagger signature-cache failures introduced during development were fixed, not reclassified or weakened. Focused incarnation plus tagger recovery: **26 passed / 158 assertions**; earlier cross-cache/owner/snapshot gate: **49 passed / 47,608 assertions**.

Frozen-lockfile installs again checked 1,013 installs / 1,254 packages without changes. No manifests, release versions, architecture or structure documents changed. No live stores or configurations were accessed; all execution used Linux test-owned/throwaway roots. This is a committed task-branch delivery only, **to merge after 0.48.0 ships**; nothing was pushed or released.

## Current-master owner-summary readiness integration

Merged current master `fdb4253afff153d16d45c65e74f48896412895c1` (0.48.0) into this task branch before repairing the CI failure, then refreshed master again after the repair commit. The imported `historian-owner-readiness.test.ts` is byte-identical to master's file: the failing test was ported as-is, not weakened.

`readTagOwnerSummary` now captures the initial identity revision alongside its same-connection appended rows. It performs **one indexed KV read only when the cached revision is null and appended rows exist**. Plain appends may create `serial:0` without changing the process identity-edit generation; storing that seed avoids a false rebuild after an unrelated peer commit. A nonzero revision is rejected rather than assigned to previously selected owner rows, preserving real identity/reasoning rewrite invalidation. Once captured, ordinary appends and idle checks add no revision lookup.

The worker path was checked rather than loosened. `scanTagOwnerDelta` already reads revision/count/highest ID in one snapshot and rejects null-to-seed mismatches; `installTagOwnerDelta` checks the live cache against the worker state; `tag-owner-warmup` validates the connection stamp around installation. Such a mismatch uses the full worker summary, which already carries the revision. Tests cover that rejection/full-warmup route and an installed legacy null-revision delta followed by the next own seeded append. Raw ordinal state does not cache this identity revision. Tagger/fallback/whitespace revision signatures already handle first seeding through their existing probes/owned-epoch capture.

Added tests prove the single initial lookup, no further lookup on later append/idle, readiness through unrelated peer metadata, and invalidation/rebuild after an initialized native peer rewrites a seeded owner and reasoning count. Focused gate: **28 passed / 250 assertions**, including cold-session warmup and all four historian-readiness tests. The fix-removal control omitted the re-read and reddened only **historian trigger keeps warm owners through unrelated peer commits** (expected true, received false); **historian trigger awaits cold owners before taking its usage snapshot** stayed green. The staged mutant had a nonempty two-line diff and restored to an empty unstaged diff.

Final merged-tree Linux gates (8 vCPUs): Bun **1.4.2**, TypeScript **5.9.3**, Biome **2.5.1**. Root typecheck, lint and build passed; lint checked 1,378 plugin / 307 Pi / 138 CLI / 6 retina files, build ran seven bundles and checked nine TUI files. Pi: **2,014 passed, 28 skipped, zero failed**, 2,042 tests across 207 files. Plugin: **7,713 passed, 27 skipped, one pre-existing offline Node-WASM fixture failure**, 7,741 tests across 781 files; the historian regression and rewrite controls are green. Frozen-lockfile installs checked 1,013 installs / 1,254 packages without changes. Master's package-version manifest changes came from the requested merge; no repair-specific dependency or lockfile changes were made. No live stores/configuration or macOS hosts were accessed, and nothing was pushed.
